<!-- Your task is to build out a Craigslist-Lite, complete with users, posts, and messages.

Routes via React Router (This is a minimum; you could have more than just these routes. These routes may be named as you wish.):

    --done-- /posts
    --done-- /profile (with messages)
    --done-- /login and /register (this could alternatively be displayed in the profile  instead of living in its own route)

Unauthenticated Users should be able to:

    --done-- See a list of all posts
    --done-- Sign up for an account with username and password
    --done-- Sign in with correct username/password combination
    
Unauthenticated Users should not be able to:

    --done-- Create a new post
    --done-- Delete any post
    --done-- Send a message to the author of any post

Authenticated Users should be able to:

    --done-- Create a new post
    --done-- Delete a post for which they are the author
    --done-- Send a message to the author of any post for which they are not the author
    --done-- See all messages for any post for which they are the author
    --done-- See all messages they've received in a special view

Authenticated Users should not be able to:

    --done-- Delete posts for which they are not the author
    --Incomplete-- Send a message to themselves

All users should be able to:

    --done-- Filter posts with a simple text matcher (no fetch call needed here)

Opportunity for EXTRA CREDIT of up to 5% added to your overall score. Authenticated Users would be delighted to be able to:

    Edit a post for which they are the author -->
